/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is in prototyping mode. As such, it prioritizes developer velocity and rapid iteration, but with a strong emphasis on preventing unauthorized data access.
 * Read access to the gallery photos collection is completely public, while write access is disallowed.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The primary data resides in the top-level `/gallery_photos/{photoId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Gallery photos are publicly readable, with no authentication required.
 * - No write operations are allowed for gallery photos. This is likely to be updated in the future, and the `// TODO` comments indicate where this change should occur.
